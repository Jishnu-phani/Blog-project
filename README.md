This project is a website containing blog posts

In this project I have used concepts of html, css, js mainly by using bootstrap. <br>
I have used flask and jinja which are python libraries to run the html and link all the files together.<br> 
(Install the python module named flask to be able to run the project)

I have also used npoint.io to create an api link which contains all the contents of the blog in the form of a json.<br>
